### Number Systems
- A bit is the most basic unit of information in a computer
  - Bit -> Binary Digit
  - Either on/off
  - Either High/Low Voltage 
  
- A byte is 8 bits
  - Smallest addressable unit in computer storage (retrieved from memory)
  
- In Intel Assembly
  - Word = 2 bytes
  - double word = 4 bytes
  - quad word = 8 bytes
  
- Fun Fact: Computers today are almost all quad words

#### Positional Numbering Systems 
- Decimal (base 10)
  - 1465<sub>10</sub> = (1 x 10<sup> 3 </sup>) + (4 x 10<sup> 2 </sup>) + 6 x 10<sup> 1 </sup>) + (5 x 10<sup> 0 </sup>) = 1000 + 400 + 60 + 5
  
- Any integer can be shown in any base (<b>radix</b>)

- Common bases
  - Decimal (10)
  - Binary (2)
  - Hexadecimal (16)
  - Octal (8)
