## Topics Covered
- Decoders
- Multiplexor (Mux)

### Decoders

- Can use logic gates to build high level components

- Common high level components include decoders and multiplexors

- An n input decoder has 2<sup> n </sup>
  - Each output goes high iff the input matches that output
  - Decoder test for each possible thing
  - <b><i>So easy to transfer a truth table to a circuit</i></b>
  
- Can be modeled with a truth table to be designed

### Multiplexor (Mux)

- Another component built using logic gates

- Has one ouput, n selects signals and 2<sup> n </sup> inputs
  - Output copies input based off value
  - <b><i>Easy to transfer truth table to a design</i></b>
  
- Can be modeled using a truth table
