## Topics Covered
- IEEE Floating Point
  - Floating Point Format
  
### Signed Numbers

- All numeric computation arithmetic is performed using <b>IEEE 754-1985</b>

- Usually 32/64-bit formats

- IEEE floating point numbers are stored:
  - Single format (32-bit) has:
    - 1 bit for sign
    - 8 bits for exponent
    - 23 bits for fraction
    
  - Double format (64-bit) has:
    - 1 bit for sign
    - 11 bits for exponent
    - 52 bits for fraction
